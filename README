These are just some basic files related to Salvation Development's Yu-Gi-Oh Pro Browser Simulator.

The script will take in these files as input:

cards.txt:

Has a list of entries in the following format:
########,##/##/####,##/##,####

These represent an 8-digit (max) code used to identify a particular card, TCG-legal date, and OCG-legal date.
If a card is not TCG-legal, the TCG date will be left blank.
If a card is not OCG-legal, the OCG date will be left blank.

lists.txt:

Has a list of entries in the following format:
!2014.7.14 (TCG+OCG)
!2014.7.14 (TCG)
!2014.7.1 (OCG)

The dates for these must be in descending order, at least for each separate format (TCG,OCG,TCG/OCG)

These represent the dates and legalities of the F&L Lists.

Output file:

This script will produce an output file in the following format:

#Built using DevPro card editor.
!2014.7.14 (TCG)
#forbidden
53797637 0
....(list of cards found to be forbidden by this script
#limit
#semi limit
!2014.7.1 (OCG)
......

It will ignore the actual contents of the limit/semi-limit list for now and only include the cards illegal at the time.
